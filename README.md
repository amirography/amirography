### Call me Amir,

#### A project in development since 1993.

Hi there! As you may have already guessed, My name is Amir.

I'm a back-end developer.

I'm passionate for developing software that once they work,
they work forever. Which means having some more overhead,
but less bugs and legacy.

Think of it as
**static languages** over **dynamic languages**
**strong type-system** over **weak type-system** 
**immutible architecture** over **mutable systems**
